        <em><b>Flowers,</b> also known as blossoms and blooms, are the reproductive structures of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant" target="_blank">flowering plants.</a></em> 
        Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk.
         <br>These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; and female gynoecia, where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an inflorescence.</p>
